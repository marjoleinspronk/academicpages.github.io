We used resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) and graph theoretical measures to test the hypothesis that CCN dysfunction may be a common factor in a broad range of mental illnesses.
We also looked at the whole-brain architecture of RSFC to test for similarity between groups by comparing FC patterns, which appeared to be highly similar across patient and control groups.
