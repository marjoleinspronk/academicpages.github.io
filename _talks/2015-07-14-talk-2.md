Seminar on the preliminary results of a multi-modal study investigating face processing and its related brain areas in humans and macaque monkeys. 
Methods used in this study included structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional connectivity, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and myelin mapping. 
Together, these methods revealed the existence of a similar face processing system in humans and monkeys, with possible functional correspondences between areas PL/OFA, ML/FFA and MF/rmSTS.
