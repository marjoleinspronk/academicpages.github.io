Hi! Thank you for visiting my site. 

My name is Marjolein and I'm a scientist with a passion for analyzing data and solving problems using data. 

I obtained a MSc degree in Bio- and Neuropsychology at Utrecht University, and a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience at Maastricht University.
My work has focused on understanding how the brain works, in particular how attention (and distraction) are regulated in the brain. 
For this I have used medical imaging techniques such as MRI and EEG.

In 2015, I started my postdoc in the lab of [Prof. Michael W. Cole](http://www.colelab.org/) at the Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience, Rutgers University.
If you want to learn more about networks and health in the brain, check out my [publications](https://marjoleinspronk.github.io/publications/) section! 

I'm currently a Data Science Fellow at [Insight](https://www.insightdatascience.com/), an intensive postdoctoral training fellowship bridging the gap between academia and data science. 

And when I'm not doing data science, I can be found outside hiking, running or just enjoying one of the many beautiful beaches in San Diego!
