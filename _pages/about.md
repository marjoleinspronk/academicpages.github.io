Hi! Thank you for visiting my site. 

My name is Marjolein and I'm a scientist with a passion for analyzing data and solving problems using data. 

I obtained a MSc degree in Bio- and Neuropsychology at Utrecht University, and a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience at Maastricht University.
My work has focused on understanding how the brain works, in particular how attention (and distraction) are regulated in the brain. 
For this I have used medical imaging techniques such as MRI and EEG.

In 2015, I started my postdoc in the lab of [Prof. Michael W. Cole](http://www.colelab.org/) at the Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience, Rutgers University.
If you want to learn more about networks and health in the brain, check out my publications section!

And when I'm not doing data science, I can be found outside hiking, running or just enjoying one of the many beautiful beaches in San Diego!
